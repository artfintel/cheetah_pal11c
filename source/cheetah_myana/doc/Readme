This is the location where the LCLS myana directory should be located.
This is only needed if you are using the very old version of Cheetah based on the myana framework.
We have removed this because myana is not backwards compatible, is not officially supported by LCLS, and goes 
out of date very rapidly.
This framework is still used by the LCLS controls and online data analysis groups.
If needed, simply put the desired version of the 'release' directory into the myana directory...
