STEP 1
------
# create an environment setup file for the particular experiment

# The cheetah installation needs to know the location of a threadsafe 
# HDF5 installation, the location of the cheetah base directory and 
# the install directory where you intend the cheetah installation to end up.
# Of course other installations can also live inside the same install directory.

# An example environment setup is shown below, showing only lines required for
# the cheetah installation. Other lines should be added for hitfinder (a script
# which runs cheetah), details are given elsewhere.

# source the environment setup file

	set_environment_feb13	
	---------------------------------------------------------------
	#!/bin/bash

	# for cheetah
	export hdf5installdir="/reg/d/psdm/CXI/cxi76713/scratch/install"
	export cheetahdir="/reg/neh/home3/rjbean/cheetah"
	export installdir="/reg/neh/home3/rjbean/software/cheetah"

	---------------------------------------------------------------


------
STEP 2
------
# the cheetah source files, the installed libraries and the hdf5 libraries
# must also be in the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# an example .profile file with the necessary lines is given below which also
# sources the environment file created in STEP 1
# if you already have an existing cheetah directory in $PATH that is not the one
# in the environment file above then exit and log back in so that $PATH only
# contains the new cheetah directory
# source the modified .profile file

	.profile
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	# prompt setup
	export PS1="\[\033[34m\]\h:\[\033[31m\]\w\\$\[\033[0m\] "

	# SLAC setup
	test -f /reg/g/psdm/etc/ana_env.sh && . /reg/g/psdm/etc/ana_env.sh

	# source current experiment environment file
	source ~/config/set_environment_feb13

	# set PATH

	export PATH="~/bin:$PATH"
	export PATH="${hdf5installdir}/bin:$PATH"
	export PATH="/reg/data/ana12/cxi/cxi76713/scratch/install/bin:$PATH"

	# show the current path
	echo PATH
	echo -e ${PATH//:/\\n}

	# set LD_LIBRARY_PATH

	# libcheetah library location
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${installdir}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
	# psana module library location
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${cheetahdir}/source/lcls-psana/arch/x86_64-rhel5-gcc41-opt/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

	# hdf5 library location
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="${hdf5installdir}/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
	# any other installation locations...
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/reg/d/psdm/cxi/cxi76713/scratch/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

	export HDF5_DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK=1

	# show LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	echo LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	echo -e ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH//:/\\n}
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# if you are running a completely clean installation some of the libraries pointed
# to will not yet exist so a re-source of profile may be needed after the cheetah install

# if you look at your PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH at this point you will see
# /reg/g/psdm/sw/releases/ana-current/arch/x86_64-rhel5-gcc41-opt/bin and ..../lib respectively
# these are updated later to a specific release eg /sw/releases/ana-0.9.17/arch/x.......
# which is necessary for cheetah/psana to run 


------
STEP 3
------
# go to the cheetah base directory
# source the source_me_before_build script

	
	source_me_before_build	
	----------------------------------------------
	#!/bin/bash
	
	cd ${cheetahdir}/source/lcls-psana

	relupgrade ana-current
	sit_setup

	export CHEETAH=psana

	cd ${cheetahdir}
	----------------------------------------------


# the sit_setup command adds the path of the most recent SLAC release version of psana 
# to LD_LIBARARY_PATH the script must be sourced so that the environment variable escapes 
# the script if you type: "which psana" after this step, the path should have a specific 
# numbered psana release, the same numbered release is also added to your $LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# the export CHEETAH=psana line points hitfinder to run the SLAC pre-compiled psana with
# the matching release number as opposed to any locally installed version. 

------
STEP 4 
------
# run the build-all-nomod script
# if your paths and environment are set as above no modification should be needed
# if anything in either libcheetah or the psana modules are modified the libraries
# should be rebuilt.


	build-all-nomod
	----------------------------------------------------------
	#!/bin/bash

	# build-all script no mod version

	# required by the libcheetah makefile
	export HDF5DIR=${hdf5installdir}
	export CHEETAHDIR=${cheetahdir}
	export LIBPATH=${installdir}/lib

	# libcheetah build
	# 1. remove previous versions of libraries
	cd ${LIBPATH}
	rm libcheetah.s*

	# 2. build libcheetah libraries
	cd ${CHEETAHDIR}/source
	make clean
	make libcheetah

	# 3. move compiled libraries to install folder
	mkdir -p $installdir
	mkdir -p $LIBPATH
	cp libcheetah.so.1.0 $LIBPATH/libcheetah.so.1.0
	cp libcheetah.so.1.0 $LIBPATH/libcheetah.so.1
	cp libcheetah.so.1.0 $LIBPATH/libcheetah.so

	# 4. remove original from cheetah/source
	rm libcheetah.so.1.0

	# psana modules build

	# 1. go to lcls-psana folder
	cd ${CHEETAHDIR}/source/lcls-psana

	# 2. build psana modules

	scons -c
	scons
	----------------------------------------------------------------
	
------
STEP 5 
------
# source .profile once more 

-----------
# debugging
-----------

# type:
	which psana
# this will give you the current psana path. In order for cheetah to work this must have 
# a specific release name. The default in the path when you log in is this:
/reg/g/psdm/sw/releases/ana-current/arch/x86_64-rhel5-gcc41-opt/bin
# it needs to be eg this:
/reg/g/psdm/sw/releases/ana-0.9.1/arch/x86_64-rhel5-gcc41-opt/bin
# this can be solved by first going to cheetah/source/lcls-psana and typing
	rel_upgrade ana_current
	sit_setup
# if the release number you get from this is different from the one with which you built
# the cheetah-ana-mod library then you need to run the build-all-nomod script again

# if cheetah says it is not executable
# type: 
	export CHEETAH=psana	
# remembering that the psana path must mention a specific release
