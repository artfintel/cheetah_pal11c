This is an example analysis pipeline that might be useful
when beginning an analysis session for a particular 
experiment.

You will want to copy the contents of this directory to some
place and modify scripts as needed.

First go to the config directory and modify the script environ.
There are some scripts called "setup.bash" that may be handy.  
Go to config/mask and generate some masks
Go to config/geom and generate a reasonable Cheetah geometry file
Go to config/ini/example and generate some Cheetah config files
Then go to hitfinder and try running run-cheetah-psana

Sorry, but you will need to install a bunch of dependencies, e.g.
- python with h5py
- crystfel
- make_pixelmap
Or, use someone else's compiled programs.
