# example environment for Cheetah analysis with hitfinder script
#
# I find it handy to have a small function in my bash startup script,
# sort of like this:
#
# function mytest ()
# {
#         export expt=$FUNCNAME
#         mkdir -p $HOME/$expt
#         cd $HOME/$expt
#         source config/environ
#         export PS1="$expt-\h> "
#         umask 002
# }
#
# once this function is in your startup script, and the script is 
# sourced, you can simply type e.g. mytest to setup your 
# analysis session in the example above
#
# r. kirian

export XTCDIR="/reg/d/ana11/cxi/data/cxi22010-gjw" # raw data here
export TMPDIR="$HOME/mytest/tmp"       # temporary files are necessary
export H5DIR="$HOME/mytest/hdf5"       # your cheetah output goes here
export CONFIGDIR="$HOME/mytest/config" # cheetah configuration seach path
export CHEETAH="psana"                 # the cheetah frontend
export PSANA_CONFIG="$CONFIGDIR/ini/other/psana.cfg" # for psana frontend


# make sure there is a space for temporary files!
mkdir -p $TMPDIR
mkdir -p $H5DIR

[ -d $XTCDIR ] || echo "xtc directory does not exist!"
[ -d $TMPDIR ] || echo "tmp directory does not exist!"
[ -d $H5DIR  ] || echo "hdf5 directory does not exist!"
[ -d $CONFIGDIR  ] || echo "config directory does not exist!"
type $CHEETAH >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "can't find cheetah frontend!"

# be careful where you dump all the cheetah output.  E.g. your home 
# directory is probably not appropriate.  LCLS provides scratch space
# for each experiment, which would be a better place to put such data.
